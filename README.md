# ImageToSTL
This is a utility program written by one of my students. It takes as input an image and uses the brightness of each pixel to determine height in a 3D-mesh. It creates a closed 3D-model and can output that model in standard STL format understood by 3D-printers. There is an easy to use UI with a few additional features like the ability to scale the model along x,y,z axis, and ability a smooth operation to the model. He did a great job with a full documentation package with video demonstration of the application , diagrams of the program design, explanation of algorithms used and more.
